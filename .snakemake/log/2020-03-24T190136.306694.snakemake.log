Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	tree_builder
	1

rule tree_builder:
    input: workflow/all_sequences.aln
    output: workflow/tree.dnd, workflow/score.txt
    jobid: 0

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 17 of /home/mark/Рабочий стол/bioinf/urfu_bioinf_2020/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
workflow/score.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job tree_builder since they might be corrupted:
workflow/tree.dnd
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
